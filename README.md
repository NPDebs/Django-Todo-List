A Django project containing a "To-do List" app. Functionally, it lets the user write, organise and prioritise tasks efficiently.
In addition to creating new tasks, there is also a function that allows the user delete completed (or less-important) tasks.
The template is essentially plain HTML code written with Django Template Language.
